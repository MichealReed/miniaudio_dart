## Usage

This package is endorsed, which means you can simply use `miniaudio_dart` normally. This package will be automatically included in your app when you do, so you do not need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml`.

However, if you import this package to use any of its APIs directly, you should add it to your `pubspec.yaml` as usual.
